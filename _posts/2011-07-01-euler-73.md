[How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d â‰¤ 12,000?](http://projecteuler.net/problem=73)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
 
from fractions import gcd
 
s = 4
e = 12001
 
nf = 0
 
for d in xrange(s, e):
    for n in xrange(d/3 - 1, d/2 + 1):
        if d < 3*n and 2*n < d:
            if gcd(n, d) == 1:
                nf += 1
 
print(nf)
```
